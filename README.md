# Score keeper

It is a website that stores scores for two-player playing against each other up to a user-defined limit (3, 5, 8, 10, or 12), and whenever one of the players reaches the defined limit, it will win.

The score for that player will change its color to green, and the opponent's score color will change to red.

You can reuse the scorekeeper repeatedly by just pressing reset after each use.
